## How it works

This 3-Bit Password Circuit works by using an 8 Switch component to send a 3-bit input and a 3-bit password and compares the two bit strings and sends an output signal to a LED Indicator.

## How to test

Run the Circuit and set the last 3 switches, number 6 7 and 8, to the 3-Bit password. Then use the first three switches, number 1-3, to the 3-Bit password and the LED Indicator will light when the two 3-Bit sets match. 

## External hardware

8 Bit Switch (Input Component; Can be split into two different input panels for differentiating input and password setting.) and an LED Indicator.
